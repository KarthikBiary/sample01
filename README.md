# Sensor Failure Prediction System
## Project Report

### 1. Introduction

This project implements a machine learning application to predict sensor failures based on various vehicle sensor readings. The system utilizes a Random Forest classifier to analyze patterns in sensor data and predict potential failures before they occur, which could be crucial for preventive maintenance in automotive or industrial settings.

### 2. Project Overview

The application consists of two main components:
- A data analysis and model training implementation script (`implementation.py`)
- A graphical user interface for interacting with the system (`sensor-analysis-gui.py`)

The project demonstrates practical application of machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a user-friendly interface.

### 3. Data Description

The system works with sensor data containing the following features:
- **battery_voltage**: Voltage reading from the battery
- **engine_temp**: Engine temperature in degrees
- **tire_pressure**: Pressure reading from tires
- **vibration**: Vibration measurements
- **speed**: Vehicle speed
- **brake_wear**: Brake pad wear measurements
- **suspension_shocks**: Suspension system readings
- **timestamp**: Time when readings were recorded

The target variable is:
- **failure**: Binary indicator (0 = no failure, 1 = failure)

### 4. Implementation Details

#### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
1. Handling missing values by removing incomplete records
2. Feature engineering:
   - Extracting time-based features (hour, day of week, month) from timestamps
   - Calculating moving averages for key sensors (battery voltage, engine temperature, vibration)
3. Data normalization and preparation for model training

```python
# Example of time-based feature extraction
df['hour'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour
df['day_of_week'] = df['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
df['month'] = df['timestamp'].dt.month

# Example of moving average calculation
window_size = 10
df['battery_voltage_ma'] = df['battery_voltage'].rolling(window=window_size).mean()
```

#### 4.2 Model Selection and Training

The project uses a Random Forest Classifier with the following configuration:
- Number of estimators (trees): 100 (configurable in GUI)
- Random state: 42 (configurable in GUI)
- Test size: 20% (configurable in GUI)

The model was selected for its robustness, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and feature importance capabilities.

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

The system evaluates model performance using:
- Accuracy score
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix
- Feature importance visualization

### 5. Graphical User Interface

The GUI provides a user-friendly way to interact with the system through three main tabs:

#### 5.1 Data Tab
- Load data from CSV files or generate sample data
- View dataset summary statistics
- Visualize feature distributions by failure status

#### 5.2 Model Tab
- Configure model parameters (number of trees, test size, random state)
- Train the model and view performance metrics
- Visualize feature importance

#### 5.3 Predict Tab
- Input sensor values manually
- Get failure predictions and probability scores
- Visual indicators for prediction results

### 6. Implementation Analysis

#### 6.1 Key Programming Concepts Used

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - The GUI is implemented as a class (`SensorAnalysisApp`) with well-defined methods
   - Encapsulation of data and functionality within the class

2. **Event-Driven Programming**:
   - Functions triggered by user actions (button clicks, dropdown selections)
   - Callback methods for updating the interface based on user input

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Integration of Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating informative visualizations
   - Dynamic chart generation based on selected features

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - Try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully
   - User-friendly error messages through message boxes

#### 6.2 Libraries and Technologies

- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework

### 7. Results and Discussion

The implemented system successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning for sensor failure prediction. Through the feature importance analysis, the system identifies the most influential factors in determining failures:

1. Key factors likely to indicate failure:
   - Low battery voltage
   - High engine temperature
   - Excessive vibration

In the sample data implementation, the model achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between normal operation and potential failure conditions.

### 8. Challenges and Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, several challenges were encountered:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and creating meaningful features from raw sensor data.
2. **GUI Design**: Creating an intuitive user interface that balances functionality with ease of use.
3. **Model Integration**: Connecting the machine learning model with the GUI components.

Learning outcomes include:
- Practical experience with the full machine learning pipeline
- GUI development using Tkinter
- Integration of data visualization with user interfaces
- Implementation of interactive prediction systems

### 9. Future Improvements

The system could be enhanced with the following additions:
- Support for real-time data streams from sensors
- Implementation of additional machine learning algorithms for comparison
- More advanced feature engineering techniques
- Time series forecasting capabilities
- Export functionality for model results and predictions

### 10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning for predictive maintenance using sensor data. The combination of data analysis, model training, and user interface development provides a comprehensive solution for failure prediction that could be valuable in automotive or industrial settings.
